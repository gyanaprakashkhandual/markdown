## What CapTest Does

CapTest transforms your Selenium test code into structured test cases and bug reports automatically, without any manual input. It combines the intelligence of an AI chatbot with the discipline of a full project management and bug tracking platform.

**How it works:**

1. Install the **Capitus Tracker** extension from the VS Code Marketplace.
2. Connect your project to CapTest via the extension.
3. Write your Selenium test code inside VS Code as usual.
4. AI automatically reads your test code and generates test cases inside your CapTest project.
5. When a test runs and **fails**, a bug is automatically created and logged to the project.
6. When a test **passes**, the test case is marked resolved — no manual update needed.
